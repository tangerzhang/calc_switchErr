# calc_switchErr
A switch error indicates that a single base that is suppose to be present in one haplotype is incorrectly anchored onto another. This kind of assembly errors is likely prevalent in the haplotype-resolved genome assembly. To detect the switch errors in our phased chromosome-scale TGY genome assembly, we developed a novel pipeline (calc_switchErr), relying on a ‘truely’ phased SNP dataset, which can be generated by incorporating PacBio long reads and 10 x Genomics Linked reads. The concept of the ‘truely’ phased SNP dataset is to find the consistently phased SNPs in PacBio reads phasing and 10x reads phasing.
